This repository contains ready-to-use python wheels to install opencv-python in a headless environment such as AWS Lambda. The wheels support the x264/x265 codecs so that you can save video files in opencv with h264/h265 encoding. This is extremely useful if you want to produce files that are playable on a web browser.
